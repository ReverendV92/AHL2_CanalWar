I had a Revelation. It came to me in my sleep. I was playing AHL and joined
a server that was running a map I didn't have. Upon the first glance I 
discovered the pure genious of the map, and my awe quickly turned into
jealousy. I could have made a map like this! Then I woke up and realised no
such map existed in reality - I could make one! I got to work immediately,
in August 2007. Most of the map was done by Feb 2008, after that it's been
only minor changes here and there. The end product isn't quite the same as 
the one I was dreaming about (you know how dreams are, they really can't be
fitted into reality). But I hope you like it! Bunch of custom textures ofc.
